Welcome to sophilabs. We are excited to have you onboard. This section contains common references
you might use during your apprenticeship process.

We want you to remember these three things during your training.

* ðŸŽ“ The focus now is on learning. As part of your onboarding process you need to figure out how we
  work. What are our [values](https://sophilabs.co/values)? How we work? We will do everything we
  can to make your two months as amazing as we can and prepare you for your step after the apprenticeship.
* ðŸ—» Don't panic. The first weeks for any new hire are overwhelming. There is often an avalanche of
  introductions, meetings, and new hire paperwork and administrative tasks. Your Mentor and your
  Development Manager (DM) will give you guidance during this process.
* ðŸ™Œ We love feedback and we look for a motivating environment and culture, where everybody trusts
  each other to receive constructive feedback and get the job done. Your mentor will give and ask
  you for feedback during your apprenticeship.

## The timeline

Please review the following timeline which is ordered chronologically from the first day up to
your first client project. Your first month is invested in learning, after that you'll meet
with your DM to introduce your first project.

* [First Day](./first-day.md)
* [Self-Learning](./self-learning.md) (2-3 weeks)
* [Training Project](./training.md) (2 weeks)
* [First Client Project](./client-project.md) (3-4 weeks)

## Final words

We encourage you to propose changes to the apprentice process. We believe in a
[continuous improvement](https://man.sophilabs.io/people/#continuous-improvement) process and we
are constantly trying to do a better job at it. As an apprentice, you have much better insight into
what could make the process better for you than does someone who's been working here for five years.
Feedback is always appreciated. If you have feedback on the apprentice program, please discuss the
issue with your mentor, or DM.
