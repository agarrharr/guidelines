## Office Tour

During your first day our Office Manager will take you for a tour of the building and the
facilities, and be introduced to our team. Don't worry too much if you can't remember everybody's
name or what they do, most people understand and won’t be annoyed if you say something like:
"I'm sorry I can't quite remember your name" later on, in fact they expect it. Everyone in the
office has been the newcomer at some point, so your teammates know that to get good work out of you
and help you feel relaxed, they should be readily available to help you settle in and teach you the
ropes. In any case, you can go to the sophilabs [team page](https://sophilabs.co/team) to help
remember people faces.

Also, the first day you will be signing papers regarding your work agreement with sophilabs. Let
the Office Manager or your Development Manager (DM) know if you have any special requests.

## Trello Newcomer Board

During your first day you will be assigned a Trello board. If you need any help reach out your
Mentor, DM, or the Office Manager.

## Some Tips

* We have general Company standups every Tuesday at 11am UYT/9am EST/10 am EDT, where we make
  announcements and we speak about the latest events of sophilabs projects. Be sure to attend punctually.
* We have Friday Talks every Friday at 12:30 UYT / 11:30 EST, an instance to meet with your
  teammates, and spend some time together talking about technology related topics. Attending is
  optional and you’ll enjoy a lunch or brunch for free if you attend.
  Check out [sophilabs Manual](https://man.sophilabs.io/people/#perks) for more details.
* Ask your mentor, DM or Office Manager if you have any questions.
* We are a friendly bunch and we'd like to get to know you better! That being said, it's easy to
  feel intimidated or uncomfortable in a new environment. In sophilabs we often host meetups, and
  have after office events. So feel free to join into any of them to help meet new people.
