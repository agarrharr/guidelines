Welcome to Sophilabs. We are excited to have you onboard. This section contains common references you might use during your apprenticeship process.

We want you to remember these three things during your training.

* :mount_fuji: Don't panic. The first weeks for any new hire are overwhelming. There is often an avalanche of introductions, meetings, and new hire paperwork and administrative tasks. Your Mentor and your Development Manager (DM) will give you guidance during this process.
* :mortar_board: The focus now is on learning. Before you can begin to contribute to Sophilabs, you need to figure out how we work. What are our [values](https://sophilabs.co/playbook/#values)? How we work?  We will do everything we can to make your three months as amazing as we can and prepare you for your step after the apprenticeship.
* :raised_hands: We love feedback and we look for a motivating environment and culture, where everybody trusts each other to receive constructive feedback and get the job done. Your mentor will give and ask you for feedback during your apprenticeship.

# The timeline

The rest of this section is divided in subsections, ordered chronogically from the first day up to your first client project. Your first one or two months are spent learning. After that you'll meet with your DM to discuss your promotion to a Sophilabs developer.

* [First Day](firstday.md)
* [Self Learning](selflearning.md) (2-4 weeks)
* [Training Project](training.md) (2 weeks)
* [First Client Project](clientproject.md)
