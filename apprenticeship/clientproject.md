# Your first Client Project

![Rocket Launch](https://d2wlcd8my7k9h4.cloudfront.net/static/figures/goodbye.jpg)

Our goal is to get you to the point where you can join the company as a full developer or designer.
At the end of your second month, you'll meet with your Development Manager to discuss your next steps. One of our goals is to help you land a job at the end of your apprenticeship. If you want to work at sophilabs, we will be prepared to either make you an offer or tell you there isn't a good spot for you at sophilabs.

If you will be joining us the Development Manager and the Operations Manager will find you a client so you can start working. The first weeks won't be billable to the client. We expect you to learn how the client works, study the code, any needed technology and start getting along with your new teammates.  This is the part where you stop being an full apprentice and start being a developer.

## Tips

* Ask your Development Manager for access to the project Source Code.
* Ask your new teammates how to set up your project, so you can test the code in your machine.
* Learn any technology needed for the project. We don't expect you know every up front, but we do expect you to be able to fill the gaps and become a full fledged developer when time passes.
* Don't be afraid to ask around about how the project works. Any large project can be daunting at first, so having someone else to explain how things work is essential.
