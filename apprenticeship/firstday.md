## Office tour

During your fist day our Office Manager will take you for a tour of the building and the facilities, and be introduced to our team. Don't worry too much if you can't remember everybody's name or what they do, most people understand that and wonâ€™t be annoyed if you say something like: "I'm sorry I can't quite remember you name" later on, in fact they expect it. Everyone in the office has been the newbie at some point, so your teammates know that in order to get good work out of you and help you feel relaxed, they should be readily available to help you settle in and teach you the ropes. If you need a refresh you can go to the sophilabs [team page](https://sophilabs.co/team) to help remembering people faces.

Also The first day you will be signing papers regarding your work agreement with sophilabs. Let the Operations Manager or your  Development Manager (DM) know if you have any special requests.

## Some tips

* We have general Company standups every Tuesday at 11am UYT (9am EST), where we make announcements and we speak about the latest events of sophilabs projects. Be sure to attend punctually.
* We have Friday Talks every Friday at noon, an instance to meet with your teammates, and spend some time together talking about technology related topics. Attending is optional and the lunch is free. Check out [sophilabs Manual](https://man.sophilabs.io/people/#perks) for more details.
* Ask your mentor, DM or Office Manager if you have any questions.
* We are a friendly bunch and we'd like to get to know you better! That being said, it's easy to feel intimidated or uncomfortable in a new environment. sophilabs often host meetups, and have after office events. So feel free to join into any of them to help meeting new people.
