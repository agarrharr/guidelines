# Self learning Path

## Introduction

As an apprentice we don't expect you to know everything about Software Development. In the following one or two months aftet your arrival to the company you will focus to learn the ropes. Your mentor will assist you during this process and give you feedback along the way. We understand every new hire has a unique skillset, so we will give you objectives to learn to get up to speed in the basics about anything we think you should learn.


## The plan

In this prcess which takes from one up to two months, you will learn the some skills used in the majority of the projects, along with our common practices described in the [Playbook](https://sophilabs.co/playbook/). After you finish this process you will be more familiar with our style of work and be ready to start participating in a client project with more experienced Developers. We want you to get used to make Code Reviews, give and receive feedback, follow our guidelines on the different languages, and learn more about the technology stack we usually employ in our client projects.


We divide the self learning in two parts: The techoncal skills, and the soft skills. The first one is based in the skills needed to be familiar with the tools used in the majority of projects. We like to complement techincal skills with soft skills, as software engineers should have a good balance betweeen those two to reach their full potential. Software engineering is also a human activity, where communication is crucial, specially when dealing with people of other cultures, in an online environment where listening and expressing can be much different from communicating with a fellow teammate.

We usually organize self training by setting up a [Trello](http://trello.com/) board in the same way you newcomers do in their first day. The board will have one or more tasks related to self learning, and some tests along the way.

## Self learning topics

The tecnhical skills included in the Trello board are the following ones, depending on your technical background.

* Backend programming [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Frontend programming using [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* Containerization using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Database Progreamming using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Versioning Software with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) basics
* [Agile](https://sophilabs.co/playbook/#the-agile-way) and [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) practices

During your self learning your mentor may give you quick assignment projects to allow us to give you feedback and to reinforce what you learned.

For communication skills we may include the following topics and activities:

* Introduction to communication for Software Engineers
* A sample Customer call
* English assesment test (for non native English speakers)
* [Continuous Improvement](https://man.sophilabs.io/people/#continuous-improvement) process

## Training accounts

Be sure to ask your Development Manager (DM) for training accounts to start your training. We use different sources for each topic. We have a [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) account used for some training. We use some other sources depending on the topic, such as Khan Academy, so be sure to have them set up properly to avoid any hassle during your training.

## Tips for self learning

Taken from https://www.ivywise.com/ivywise-knowledgebase/newsletter/article/self-studying-whats-the-benefit-and-how-to-do-it/

Self-learning does take a lot of discipline and can be difficult at first, but like any endeavor, with time it becomes easier. Self-study, when done correctly, is a very effective learning tool, so it can be helpful when used to prepare for a test or learn an entirely new subject matter on your own. Here are some tips for practicing successful self-studying:

* Prepare and maintain your study environment. When learning remotely it is important to have an adequate study space. If you want, you can relax in a sofa in the office while reading. We usually do this in Sophilabs. In the same way we meet in meeting rooms, we eat at the dinning room, you may find more effective to learn outside you assigned space.
* Find what works for you: There are many different ways to learn, and it is important to adjust studying techniques to find what works for your brain. The sites we include are good start points. We encourage you to keep going and try different sites if you find them more useful.
* Review material the same day you learn it. After taking notes in an online course, or reading the next chapter in your textbook, make sure you review all the new material, by typing up your notes, practicing your new skill using a [Breakable Toy](http://redsquirrel.com/dave/work/a2j/patterns/BreakableToys.html) Project.
* Study in short, frequent sessions. Instead of treating your study session like a marathon, break up your material by topic into a series of short sessions, separated by short breaks.
