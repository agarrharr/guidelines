As an apprentice, after your self learning process you will be assigned to do a Ticket System Project to apply all your knowledge and to have another instance to learn, give and recieve feedback from your Mentor. The actual specifications of the Ticket System are online at https://github.com/sophilabs/training. Your mentor will give you the actual requirements for the projects and a deadline, which can be anywhere from one week up to two weeks. This project is a good opportunity to practice before a real client, handling dealines, expectations, negociating a real scope, and prioritizing.

### Gitlab Repo setup
We create a gitlab repository for the tickets training. Make sure you have access to the private company's [gitlab](https://git.sophilabs.io/). Please set up [gilp](https://sophilabs.co/blog/gulp-and-commit-hooks-gilp) commit hooks for Python, and Javascript languages. You can download a sample gilp ready `gulpfile.js` [here](https://github.com/sophilabs/gilp/blob/master/examples/full.js) and adapt it to your needs.

### Code Reviews & Merge Requests
You should follow a [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)  branching model development. In this project this means whenever you make a new feature you must create a feature branch for the work you are doing. Whenever you finish your work you should create a [Merge Request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html) so every commit into the master branch is reviewed by your mentor. Your mentor will review your code following the [Code Review](https://sophilabs.co/playbook/#code-reviews) flow and give you feedback on your work.
### Frontend Tests

## Tips

* *Prioritize*: Mandatory requirements vs Optional. Consider doing mandatory requirements first, and then focusing into the optional ones if you have time.
* *Organize*: your work using a Trello Board, this will prevent you on getting stuck and focusing in the important things.
* *Negociate* requirements. Any developer should negociate if the scope is too big. Feel free to negociate deadlines and requirements with your mentor. This is a common practice in software projects.
* *Ask* around if you get stuck. In Sophilabs we have several ways to get help if needed.
    * Use `/guru` slack command to find expert people in certain your question. Try it in any channel
    *  the appropiate Slack channels such as [#developers](https://sophilabs.slack.com/messages/developers), [#python](https://sophilabs.slack.com/messages/python), or [#react_redux](https://sophilabs.slack.com/messages/react_redux)
    * Ask your mentor. He might know or point you towards the right direction.
