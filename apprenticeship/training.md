As an apprentice, after your self learning process you will be assigned to do a Ticket System Project to apply all your knowledge and to have another instance to learn, give and recieve feedback from your Mentor. The actual specifications of the Ticket System are online at https://github.com/sophilabs/training. Your mentor will give you the actual requirements for the projects and a deadline, which can be anywhere from one week up to two weeks. This project is a good opportunity to practice before a real client, handling dealines, expectations, negociating a real scope, and prioritizing.
