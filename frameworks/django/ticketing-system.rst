Ticketing System
----------------


Purpose
=======

The purpose of this assignment is to learn to design and develop a complete web app using the Django framework.


Requirements
============

Build a web based ticketing system supporting multiple projects, tagging system, signing in with social networks, and reports generation.

Users sign up/sign in to the system and go to their dashboard.
In the header of the page a filter by project will be always present.

From here the user will be able to navigate to different areas of the app

Views
=====

These are going to be the main views:

Sign up
^^^^^^^

A form requiring First Name, Last Name, Email and Password

Sign in
^^^^^^^

A form requiring Email and Password.
User should be able to log in with Google, GitHub or Twitter.

Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^

The dashboard shows two lists: one of them lists the tickets assigned to the user, the other one lists the ones created by the user.

Tickets
^^^^^^^

List of tickets with sorting capabilities.
Filters: Assigned user, Status, Tags, Text

Create/View/Edit ticket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tickets can be created, edited and closed.
They will have the following properties:

#. Project
#. Type (Bug, Story, Task)
#. Status (Open, In Progress, Closed, Invalid)
#. Summary
#. Description
#. Priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
#. Assignee
#. Tags
#. Estimation (in hours)

Users can add comments to a ticket and they will be shown in the ticket details page.

Record progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The assigned user of a ticket is able to log hours on it.
Each ticket has a link “log hours”, when clicking a form requiring number of hours invested and a description is shown.

Reports
^^^^^^^

In this view, the user is able to generate a PDF report per project showing the following information:

- Total Hours estimated per week
- Total Hours invested per week
- Total Hours Invested - estimated per week
- Total Tickets opened per week
- Total Tickets closed per week
- Total Tickets Opened - closed per week

For each user in the project:

- Hours estimated per week
- Hours invested per week
- Hours Invested - estimated per week
- Tickets assigned per week
- Tickets closed per week
- Tickets assigned - closed per week

This report should be generated using a background job. When processing is done in the server, the download link becomes available in the front end.

Admin area
==========

The administrator is responsible for managing projects, users and tags in the backend

Projects
^^^^^^^^

They have a name, a description and users associated

Tags
^^^^

They have just a name. They can be created, edited and deleted. If deleted, corresponding issues should be updated accordingly.
