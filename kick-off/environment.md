Setting up macOS
================

1. Install [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) and [sign
   up](https://sophilabs.slack.com/) with your sophilabs email address.
2. Install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager for
   installing applications or utilities.
3. macOS only comes with Python 2 installed. Install the latest Python
   3 release from the
   [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).
4. Avoid installing Python packages at the system level, use virtual
   environments instead. See
   [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#introduction)
   why this is the recommended approach. There are several options for
   creating/managing virtual environments, we recommend
   [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
5. Feel free to install and use your favorite text editor or IDE. If
   you don't have one, we recommend PyCharm to get started.
6. Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   if you're going to work with JavaScript.
7. Install [Docker for
   Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install), use the edge
   version if you need better integration with docker cloud.
8. Setup a pair of ssh keys with your sophilabs email address. You can
   follow [this
   guide](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
   if you're not sure how to do it. You will use these keys to push
   content to our Gitlab server or Github repositories, and also for
   accessing any remote server you need to access when working on a
   project.
