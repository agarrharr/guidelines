# Project's Manifesto

Your project manifesto is a document targeted mostly to newcomers
so they can start working without inconvenience.

Your project's manifesto should include all necessary instructions in order to
set up the project, run it, run tests, etc.

## How to implement a manifesto in my project

Just download the [README.md](./README.md) file and adapt it to your project.
