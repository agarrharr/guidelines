Code reviews
------------

Introduction
============

A code review is the process of manually inspecting source code written by
another person. It allows us to find errors that might have been overlooked by
the original author, and it does so at an early stage. Code reviews are not
only for finding errors though; reading code written by someone else can
improve our own skills and knowledge.

Process
=======

As the developer [#DP]_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use `Gitlab <https://git.sophilabs.io/>`__ or
`Github <https://github.com/sophilabs>`_ to manage our code reviews. We'll be
referring to Gitlab from now on since it's what you'll be using most of the
time, but they're fairly similar.

Every time you push changes to your branch Gitlab will allow you to open a code
review to merge those changes onto a branch of your choice (usually ``dev``,
but it will depend on the project you're working on). You get to choose the
reviewer as well, typically your team will instruct you on who to choose.

After the reviewer finishes, they will either merge your changes or add
comments (you will see these comments in Gitlab) to your code, probably
requesting to change/fix something. Some people prefer to simply talk to the
developer instead of adding comments, which is also fine. In the case you
receive feedback, you will need to make the necessary changes to your code and
push your branch again; Gitlab will automatically update the code review so the
reviewer sees the latest version of your code.

**Tips**

#. Don't check only your code: also make sure your branch is correctly named
   (naming conventions will depend on the project) and that you're requesting
   to merge your changes onto the right branch.
#. Avoid sending too many changes in one merge review as it get's easier for
   the reviewer to overlook errors if there is too much code to review. The
   ideal amount of code will depend on the language, but try to stay under 300
   lines overall.
#. The primary reviewer is the author i.e. YOU.
#. Create a checklist for yourself of the things that the code reviews tend
   to focus on. Some of this checklist should be easy to put together. It
   should follow the outline of the coding standards document. Because it’s
   your checklist, you can focus on the thing that you struggle with and skip
   the things that you rarely, if ever, have a problem with. Run through your
   code with the checklist and fix whatever you find. Not only will you
   reduce the number of things that the team finds, you’ll reduce the time to
   complete the code review meeting—and everyone will be happy to spend less
   time in the review.
#. You are not your code. Remember that the entire point of a review is to
   find problems, and problems will be found. Don’t take it personally when
   one is uncovered.
#. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find
   them early, before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the
   few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely
   fatal in our industry, so we can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on.
#. No matter how much “karate” you know, someone else will always know
   more. Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek
   and accept input from others, especially when you think it’s not needed.
#. Don’t rewrite code without consultation. There’s a fine line between
   “fixing code” and “rewriting code.” Know the difference, and pursue
   stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone
   enforcer.
#. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it
   with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool
   as a new challenge, not as some serious inconvenience to be fought.
#. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat. Understand
   that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you do turn out to
   be right, don’t take revenge or say, “I told you so” more than a few
   times at most, and don’t make your dearly departed idea a martyr or
   rallying cry.
#. Don’t be “the guy in the room.” Don’t be the guy coding in the dark
   office emerging only to buy cola. The guy in the room is out of touch, out
   of sight, and out of control and has no place in an open, collaborative
   environment.
#. Please note that Review meetings are NOT problem solving meetings.
#. Help to maintain the coding standards. Offer to add to the coding
   standards for things discussed that aren’t in the coding standards. One
   of the challenges that a developer has in an organization with combative
   code review practices is that they frequently don’t know where the next
   problem will come from. If you document each issue into the coding
   standards, you can check for it with your checklist the next time you
   come up for code reviews. It also will help cement the concept into your
   mind so that you’re less likely to miss opportunities to use the feedback.

As the reviewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When someone assigns you a code review, you will get a notification from Gitlab
by email. Simply visit the link in it and Gitlab will show you a page with a
diff between the two versions of each modified file. You are able to add
comments to individual lines of each file. If you do so, the author will update
their code and push their branch again, then you will see an updated view of
the merge request under the same url.

**Tips** [#CP]_


#. Don't check only the code: also make sure the branch is correctly named
   (naming conventions will depend on the project) and that the author is
   requesting to merge their changes onto the right branch.
#. Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.
   As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to
   improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs,
   increased performance, etc.
#. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and
   patience. Nontechnical people who deal with developers on a regular basis
   almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and
   crybabies at worst. Don’t reinforce this stereotype with anger and
   impatience.
#. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
   Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect – so if
   you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.
#. Please note that Review meetings are NOT problem solving meetings.
#. Ask questions rather than make statements. A statement is accusatory.
   “You didn’t follow the standard here” is an attack—whether intentional
   or not. The question, “What was the reasoning behind the approached
   you used?” is seeking more information. Obviously, that question can’t
   be said with a sarcastic or condescending tone; but, done correctly, it can
   often open the developer up to stating their thinking and then asking if
   there was a better way.
#. Avoid the “Why” questions. Although extremely difficult at times,
   avoiding the”Why” questions can substantially improve the mood. Just as
   a statement is accusatory—so is a why question. Most “Why” questions can
   be reworded to a question that doesn’t include the word “Why” and the
   results can be dramatic. For example, “Why didn’t you follow the standards
   here…” versus “What was the reasoning behind the deviation from the
   standards here…”
#. Remember to praise. The purposes of code reviews are not focused at
   telling developers how they can improve, and not necessarily that they did
   a good job. Human nature is such that we want and need to be acknowledged
   for our successes, not just shown our faults. Because development is
   necessarily a creative work that developers pour their soul into, it often
   can be close to their hearts. This makes the need for praise even more
   critical.
#. Make sure you have good coding standards to reference. Code reviews
   find their foundation in the coding standards of the organization. Coding
   standards are supposed to be the shared agreement that the developers
   have with one another to produce quality, maintainable code. If you’re
   discussing an item that isn’t in your coding standards, you have some work
   to do to get the item in the coding standards. You should regularly ask
   yourself whether the item being discussed is in your coding standards.
#. Remember that there is often more than one way to approach a solution.
   Although the developer might have coded something differently from how
   you would have, it isn’t necessarily wrong. The goal is quality,
   maintainable code. If it meets those goals and follows the coding
   standards, that’s all you can ask for.
#. You shouldn’t rush through a code review - but also, you need to do it
   promptly. Your coworkers are waiting for you.
#. Review fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time.
