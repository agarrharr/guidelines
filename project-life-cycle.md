# Project's life cycle

## Purpose

A project's life cycle is composed of a number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are
used by engineers to plan for, design, build, test, and deliver applications. It aims to produce
high-quality application that meet or exceed customer expectations, based on customer requirements,
by delivering systems which move through each clearly defined phase,
within scheduled time frames and cost estimates.<sup>1</sup>
