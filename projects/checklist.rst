Code Analysis Checklist
=======================

- For every language use linters tool to verify code style guidelines. The following
  tools are preferred:
  
  - `flake8` for Python.
  - `eslint` for Javascript.
  - `scsslint` for Sass.
  - `htmllint` for HTML.
  - `credo` for Elixir.
  
- Define Commit Message guidelines. For example `/\d+: [A-Z](\w|\s)*\./` (e.g. 555: Title finished by a dot character.).
- Use commit hooks to verify the code style guidelines and the commit message by overriding the following files `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and `.git/hooks/commit-msg` respectively.
- The master branch, or the equivalent for the project must be protected, meaning all commits must be merged from feature branches
- Every commit must be made inside a particular branch that encapsulate that particular task.
- Code reviews must be enforced before merging code to the master branch.
- Code reviews should follow the guidelines in the Sophilabs Playbook.
- Every project must have a README file for new hires explaining the Tools needed for work and processes involved in the everyday work. This includes

  - Development tools: Text editors, IDEs, Plugins
  - Required environment files
  - Procedures for installing Hooks
