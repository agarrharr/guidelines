Project's Manifesto
-------------------

The project manifesto is a way for the project team to [TODO].

What should I put in my project's manifesto?
============================================
Your project's manifesto should include all necessary instructions in order to set up the project, run it, run tests, etc. It's targeted mostly to newcomers so they can start working without inconvenience.

Ideally, you should include a section per squad.

Testing section
```````````````
The testing section of your manifesto should include instructions for:

- Downloading and installing all required testing dependencies.
- Setting all required environment variables for running tests.
- Running the testing tool(s).
- Generating coverage reports.
- Any particular practice that your team encourages when it comes to writing tests.

How to implement a manifesto in my project?
===========================================

Just download the `README.md <./README.md>`__ file and adapt it to your project.
